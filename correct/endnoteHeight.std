   Hope your projects are going well! Be sure to include a bunch of unit
tests[1]. This is to make sure you have unlimited textHeight[2] on your
endnotes.
[1] Hilfinger mentioned we'll be graded on testing this time.
[2] Meaning you can't have form feed characters before any of your
    endnotes.
